These guidelines apply to Go code and supplement any other general development instructions or workflows.

# Go Code Guidelines

- All Go code is expected to adhere to the rules outlined in the Giant Swarm style guide located at @https://github.com/giantswarm/fmt/tree/main/go .
- Always fetch and fully understand the style guide before reviewing any code.
- The Giant Swarm style guide linked above must always be considered definitive. ALL rules and provisions contained in the style guide MUST be met.
- When applying the style guide, always list all instances of a particular issue, grouped by the finding type.

## Formatting

CI will perform the following check for proper code formatting and sorting/grouping of imports:

```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest && \
if [[ -n $(goimports -local github.com/${CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME}/${CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME} -l .) ]];
then
  goimports -local github.com/${CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME}/${CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME} -d . && exit 1;
fi
```

When creating or modifying Go files, perform the according check and mitigate any issues before committing.
