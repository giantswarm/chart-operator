# chart-operator

The chart-operator deploys Helm charts as [helm] releases. It is implemented
using [operatorkit].

## Branches

- `main`
    - Latest version using Helm 3.
- `helm2`
    - Legacy support for Helm 2.

## chart CR

The operator deploys charts hosted in a Helm repository. The chart CRs are
managed by [app-operator] which provides a higher level abstraction for
managing apps via the app CRD.

### Example chart CR

```yaml
apiVersion: application.giantswarm.io/v1alpha1
kind: Chart
metadata:
  name: "prometheus"
  labels:
    chart-operator.giantswarm.io/version: "1.0.0"
spec:
  name: "prometheus"
  namespace: "monitoring"
  config:
    configMap:
      name: "prometheus-values"
      namespace: "monitoring"
    secret:
      name: "prometheus-secrets"
      namespace: "monitoring"
  tarballURL: "https://giantswarm.github.io/app-catalog/prometheus-1-0-0.tgz"
```
